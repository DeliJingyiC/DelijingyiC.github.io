## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computational Linguistics at The Ohio State University, specializing in speech synthesis, multimodal large language models, and reinforcement learning for audio. I work under the supervision of Dr. Micha Elsner and Dr. Andrew Perrault. My research focuses on advancing speech synthesis through reinforcement learning and diffusion models, developing speech emotion conversion systems, and creating benchmarks for evaluating multimodal LLMs on emotional speech understanding. 

Previously, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science & Engineering at OSU and earned my B.A. in Linguistics from Sichuan International Studies University in China. I have industry experience as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon, where I developed production-ready speech emotion transfer systems and recommendation models.

## Research Interests

- **Speech Synthesis:** Text-to-speech systems, diffusion models, emotional speech generation, GANs for speech representation learning
- **Multimodal Large Language Models:** Speech-text cooperation, instruction tuning, semantic-emotion disentanglement
- **Reinforcement Learning for Audio:** RLHF, reward-based optimization, model fine-tuning
