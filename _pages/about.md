I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering as well as a PhD in Computational Linguistics at The Ohio State University advised by [Dr. Micha Elsner](https://u.osu.edu/elsner.14/) and [Dr. Andrew Perrault](https://aperrault.github.io). My research focuses on reinforcement learning, cognitive modeling of language acquisition, computational phonology, and speech synthesis.

Updates
======
* 07/2023: Our paper received ACL 2023 Area Chair Awards (Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics).
* 05/2023: Our paper on exploring how GANs learn phonological representations was accepted to ACL 2023 main conference.
* 03/2022: I was awarded the Summer Graduate Research Award from The Center for Cognitive and Brain Sciences at OSU! Super grateful for my Advisor Dr. Micha Elsner! 

Research Experiences
======
Optimizing Speech Model Using Advanced RL techniques (2023-present)
* Exploring and designing efficient reinforcement learning techniques for better speech model alignment

Neural discovery of abstract inflectional structure	(2023-present)
* Train a transformer model to handle feature-guided character-level transduction with Reinforcement Learning
* NSF-BCS-2217554; Principal Investigator: Dr. Micha Elsner and Dr. Andrea Sims

Explore How GANs Learn Phonological Representations (2021-2022)
* Train two Convolutional Neural Networks models on English words and French words in an unsupervised manner
* Visualize and interpret the intermediate layers of CNNs to explore what linguistics representations are learned from raw speech data by CNNs and how nasalization acoustic features are encoded in different layers of CNNs
