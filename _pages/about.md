I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering as well as a PhD in Computational Linguistics at The Ohio State University advised by [Dr. Micha Elsner](https://u.osu.edu/elsner.14/) and [Dr. Andrew Perrault](https://aperrault.github.io). My research focuses on reinforcement learning, cognitive modeling of language acquisition, computational phonology, and speech synthesis.

Updates
======
* 07/2023: Our paper received ACL 2023 Area Chair Awards (Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics).
* 05/2023: Our paper on exploring how GANs learn phonological representations was accepted to ACL 2023 main conference.
* 03/2022: I was awarded the Summer Graduate Research Award from The Center for Cognitive and Brain Sciences at OSU! Super grateful for my Advisor Dr. Micha Elsner!
